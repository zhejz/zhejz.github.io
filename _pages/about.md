I am a PhD student advised by [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/people-details.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC8zMjQ4LC0xOTcxNDY1MTc4.html) at the Computer Vision Lab ([CVL](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/)) of ETH Zurich.
My project is funded by Toyota Research on Automated Cars in Europe ([TRACE](https://www.trace-lab.com/), [TRACE Zurich](https://www.trace.ethz.ch/)).
Before joining CVL I received my BSc in ITET from [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and my MSc in ITET from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html).
As master thesis topic I worked on vision-based control and considered that as my research interest since then.

My current research interests include imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world models, Transformers and their applications to autonomous driving and robotics.
In particular, I tackle the problem of planing in highly interactive driving scenarios from a data-driven perspective by combining end-to-end policy learning and neural simulation.
