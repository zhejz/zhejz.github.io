I am a research intern at the NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research Group ([AVG](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/avg/)) led by [Prof. Marco Pavone](https://research.nvidia.com/person/marco-pavone). I'm also a PhD student advised by [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://insait.ai/prof-luc-van-gool/) at the Computer Vision Lab ([CVL](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/)) of ETH Zurich. My PhD project is funded by Toyota Research on Automated Cars in Europe ([TRACE](https://www.trace-lab.com/), [TRACE Zurich](https://www.trace.ethz.ch/)). Before joining CVL I received my B.Sc. degree from [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and my M.Sc. degree from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), both in the department of information technology and electrical engineering with a focus on control and system theory. As master thesis topic I worked on vision-based control and considered that as my research interest since then.

My current research interests include imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world models, Transformers, and their applications to autonomous driving and robotics. In particular, I'm working on the problem of planning in highly interactive driving scenarios from a data-driven perspective by combining end-to-end policy learning and neural simulation.
