I am a research intern with NVIDIA's Autonomous Vehicle Research Group ([AVG](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/avg/)) led by [Prof. Marco Pavone](https://research.nvidia.com/person/marco-pavone). I earned my Ph.D. from the Computer Vision Lab ([CVL](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/)) at ETH Zurich, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://insait.ai/prof-luc-van-gool/), focusing on end-to-end autonomous driving. My PhD project is funded by Toyota Research on Automated Cars in Europe ([TRACE](https://www.trace-lab.com/), [TRACE Zurich](https://www.trace.ethz.ch/)). Before pursuing my doctorate, I was the first employee at [Seervision](https://www.seervision.com/), a Swiss start-up specializing in autonomous tracking pan-tilt-zoom cameras for streaming. Over two years as an R&D engineer, I played a key role in developing the cinematographic tracking, estimation, and control pipeline, contributing to the company’s successful seed and Series A funding rounds. I obtained a B.Sc. from [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and an M.Sc. from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), both in the department of information technology and electrical engineering with a focus on control and system theory.

My research interests span imitation and reinforcement learning, world models, Transformers, next-token prediction, and their applications to autonomous driving and robotics. My current work explores data-driven approaches to planning in highly interactive driving scenarios, leveraging the synergy between end-to-end policy learning and neural simulation to push the capabilities of autonomous vehicles to the next level.
