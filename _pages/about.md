Zhejun Zhang is a research intern at NVIDIA’s Autonomous Vehicle Research Group ([AVG](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/avg/)). He earned his Ph.D. from the Computer Vision Lab ([CVL](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/)) at ETH Zurich, where he was supervised by [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://insait.ai/prof-luc-van-gool/) and focused on end-to-end driving. Before his doctorate, Zhejun was the first employee at [Seervision](https://www.seervision.com/), a Swiss start-up making autonomous tracking cameras for broadcasting. He played a key role in developing the cinematographic tracking pipeline, contributing to the company’s seed and Series A funding rounds. Zhejun obtained a B.Sc. from TU Munich and an M.Sc. from ETH Zurich, both in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, specializing in control and system theory. He received the [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/studying-in-germany/scholarships/daad-scholarships/) (2012-2016) and [ESOP](https://ethz.ch/students/en/studies/financial/scholarships/excellencescholarship.html) (2016-2018) scholarships, completing both degrees with a top 1 ranking. Zhejun’s research interests include imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world models, post-training of next-token prediction models, and their applications to autonomous vehicles and robotics. His work has been published in top-tier venues in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning, such as CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICRA, and IROS.
